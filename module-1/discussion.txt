In responding to your classmates, compare your posts and discuss the following:

What did you find interesting or relatable in your peers' posts?
What tips can you share with your peers to help address the challenges they discussed in their initial posts?


Answer: 

1. Name one event or person that influenced you to pursue a degree in your field.

I would say Ken Thompson and Guido van Rossum are have been a huge influence to pursue development.

2. What is your comfort level with programming?

I am currently a full stack Software Engineer at Salesloft. The primary tech stack I work with is GoLang for our backend api layer / background workers and React / TypeScript for the frontend. I started learning programming with C/C++ and eventually picked up Python / JavaScript. I would say that I am very comfortable with my primary language, picking up new languages and frameworks, working on large scale applications. 

3. Which skills are you most confident in?

I would say I am most confident in the backend. I am okay with frontend development, but a large code base in React or Angular can be overwhelming at times. 

4. Which skills need the most improvement?



5. What strategies do you plan to use to manage your time and complete assignments in this course?


6. Reflect on the material you have reviewed so far in Module One. What questions do you have so far?
